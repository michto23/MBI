Użytkownik może wprowadzić własne dane w postaci 3 sekwencji nukleotydowych oraz macierzy nagród i kar, a następnie śledzić sposób wykonywania obliczeń (krok po kroku). Do wyznaczenia globalnych dopasowań wprowadzonych sekwencji, program wykorzystuje trójwymiarową wersję algorytmu Needlemana-Wunscha.\nThis project was generated with angular-cli version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nBefore running the tests make sure you are serving the app via ng serve.\nDeploying to GitHub Pages\nRun ng github-pages:deploy to deploy to GitHub Pages.\nFurther help\nTo get more help
